# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
The Handwritten Digit Recognition project was centered around the development of a machine learning solution for accurately classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
This dataset comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) in grayscale format.
